# TesseractOcrMaui

[Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) wrapper for windows and Android for .NET MAUI.

## What is this?

I didn't find any good up to date C# wrapper to Tesseract that would function with Maui on Android devices. This library wrapps native Tesseract C/C++ libraries to usable C# interfaces. Currently only Android and Windows are supported, because I don't have resources to test on MacOs or IOS. Also my own projects only support Windows and Android, so I didn't need those other platforms. If you need support for Apple devices, you have to build those libraries yourself and add them to project.

## Supported platforms

Currently supports Windows and Android. Library is meant to be used with .NET MAUI project. You can see supported cpu architechtures down below.

| platform | Architechture |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Windows  | x86_64        |
| Android  | Arm64-v8a     |
| Android  | Arm-v7a       |
| Android  | x86_64        |
| Android  | x86           |

Supported runtimes

> net7.0 or newer  
> net7.0-windows10.0.19041 or newer  
> net7.0-android or newer

Only png and jpeg libraries are compiled into tesseract native libraries, so only these image types are supported. Additional image libraries are added if needed later. 

## Getting started

### 1. Add nuget package to your project.

Package is available in `nuget.org`. You can use it in your project by adding it in your visual studio `nuget package manager or by running command

```powershell
dotnet add package TesseractOcrMaui
```

### 2. Add package to dependency injection (see TesseractOcrMauiTestApp)

<br/>

Page should be injected or injecting Tesseract won't work. `AddTesseractOcr` also loads all libraries that are needed to run library. `files.AddFile("eng.traineddata");` adds all your traineddata files to be loaded, when tesseract is used. For example I add `eng.traineddata`, so I must add [traineddata file](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/) with same name to my project's TesseractOcrMauiTestApp\Resources\Raw folder.

<br/>

MauiProgram.cs

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using MauiTesseractOcr;  // include library

namespace TesseractOcrMauiTestApp;

public static class MauiProgram
{
    public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
        builder
            .UseMauiApp<App>()
            .ConfigureFonts(fonts =>
            {
                fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Regular.ttf", "OpenSansRegular");
                fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Semibold.ttf", "OpenSansSemibold");
            });
        // Inject logging, (optional, but gives info)
        builder.Services.AddLogging();

        // Inject library functionality
        builder.Services.AddTesseractOcr(
            files =>
            {
                files.AddFile("eng.traineddata");
            });

        // Inject main page
        builder.Services.AddSingleton<MainPage>();

        return builder.Build();
    }
}
```

### 3. Inject ITesseract into your page

<br/>

Now you can constructor inject ITesseract interface to you page. I have two labels ("confidenceLabel" and "resultLabel") in my main page. I added button with clicked event handler. I you can see my `Button_Clicked` functionality down below.

<br/>

Mainpage.xaml.cs

```csharp
using MauiTesseractOcr;
using MauiTesseractOcr.Extensions;

namespace TesseractOcrMauiTestApp;

public partial class MainPage : ContentPage
{
    // inject ITesseract
    public MainPage(ITesseract tesseract)
    {
        InitializeComponent();
        Tesseract = tesseract;
    }

    ITesseract Tesseract { get; }

    private async void Button_Clicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // Make user pick file
        var pickResult = await FilePicker.PickAsync(new PickOptions()
        {
            PickerTitle = "Pick png image",
            // Currently usable image types
            FileTypes = new FilePickerFileType(new Dictionary<DevicePlatform, IEnumerable<string>>()
            {
                [DevicePlatform.Android] = new List<string>() { "image/png", "image/jpeg" },
                [DevicePlatform.WinUI] = new List<string>() { ".png", ".jpg", ".jpeg" },
            })
        });
        // null if user cancelled the operation
        if (pickResult is null)
        {
            return;
        }

        // Recognize image
        var result = await Tesseract.RecognizeTextAsync(pickResult.FullPath);

        // Show output
        confidenceLabel.Text = $"Confidence: {result.Confidence}";
        if (result.NotSuccess())
        {
            resultLabel.Text = $"Recognizion failed: {result.Status}";
            return;
        }
        resultLabel.Text = result.RecognisedText;
    }
}
```

NOTE: Tesseract depends on other packages that may be licensed under different open source licenses.

This project does not depend on any third-party C# packages, but it needs [traineddata files](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata/) to function. Parts of the code are also is reused from [Charlesw Windows Tesseract wrapper](https://github.com/charlesw/tesseract).

## Support

If you have any questions about anything related to this project, open issue with `help wanted` -tag or send me an email.

Only Android and Windows are supported currently, because I have no recources to build and test for IOS and MacOS. Integrating these platforms should not be very big problem if someone needs them, but I don't need them. If you want to add them, just contact me.
